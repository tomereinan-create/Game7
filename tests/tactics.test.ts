/**
 * THE DEVIATION TAX LAW (recal_59, permanent). Every tactic, on random matchups: the oracle-best
 * call must average at least +0.5 margin, and a BLIND deviation must average -0.3 to -1.5.
 * Balanced/default is 0 by construction. This runs on every tactics change forever — a red row
 * here means a tactic's tax is mis-calibrated, and the fix is tuning its constant, not this test.
